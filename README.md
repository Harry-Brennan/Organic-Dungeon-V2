This game is a remake of one of my previous projects Organic Dungeon which was a true-first person dungeon crawler shooter with 3 basic enemy types and basic shooter mechanics with a procedural-ish dungeon generation.

This project will expand upon and re-imagine all of the systems that were in the original and will attempt to expand the "game", which I now consider a prototype or vertical slice, into an actual game with a fun game loop and complimentary mechanics for player enjoyment.

The game will become more of a movement-shooter than the original arcade shooter but will retain the procedurally generated dungeon from the original which will also be expanded upon. One way in which the proc gen will be improved is a wider variety of rooms and their purposes including challenge rooms, parkour rooms, and other minigames alongside more combat rooms.

Additionally the game will be expanded into a more rogue-like style of game will progression tied to permanent unlocks and achievements and with floors with bosses at the end that the player must defeat before entering the next floor or looping back to the start of the game with the weapons and upgrades they have (similarly to Risk of Rain 2) unlike the originals infinite floor generation.

There will also be more enemy types implemented into this version of the game which will also make use of the improved and new custom weapon system.

This project will focus on making modular and reusable code that can be replicated easily onto enemy characters so that a wider range of enemy types can be made more easily than in the original as well as upgrades and other weapons. Also this project will be an attempt to make a weapon system that is unique and modular enough to make wacky and interesting weapons during runtime.

Also this project is an experiment to make interesting and unique UI for the player whilst keeping it minimal.
